# autobet-saltybet
This project's primary purpose was to provide myself an avenue to learn and 
practice Selenium, SQL, and Java. My implementations were directed more at targeting
certain learning goals rather than focusing on optimization.

The implementation goal of the project is to connect to a website called Salty Bet,
then collect data from the arcade fights it hosts. Once a database has been instantiated,
then the program uses the data to attempt simple predictions and gain an advantage on the fake
betting of the website.
